# stable_lds
This simple repository provides MATLAB code to estimate a linear dynamical system from data using a convex optimization. It uses YAMLIP and the sedumi solver. To run the code first init and update the respective submodules. In the terminal, go to yout stable_lds folder
```
$ cd your_stable_lds_folder
```
then
```
$ git submodule init
```
and
```
$ git submodule update
```
To run the demo, in the MATLAB command window run
```
>> demo
```
