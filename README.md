# stable_lds
This simple repository provides MATLAB code to estimate a linear dynamical system for data using a convex optimization. It uses YAMLIP and the sedumi solver. To run the code first clone the respective repositories. In the terminal, go to yout stable_lds folder
```
$ cd your_stable_lds_folder
```
then
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sqlp/sedumi
```
and
```
$ git clone https://github.com/yalmip/YALMIP
```
You don't have to run any install scripts. To test if it works, in MATLAB run 
```
>> demo
```
