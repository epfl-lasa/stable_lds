# stable_lds
This simple repository provides MATLAB code to estimate a linear dynamical system for data using a convex optimization. We rely on YAMLIP and the sedumi solver to run it. To run the code first clone both repositories. In the terminal, go to yout stable_lds folder
	cd your_stable_lds_folder
then
	git clone https://github.com/sqlp/sedumi
and 
	git clone https://github.com/yalmip/YALMIP

You don't have to run any install scripts. To test if it works, in MATLAB run 
	demo
